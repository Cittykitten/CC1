      <h2>Climate Facts</h2>
      <p>Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and other elements of the Earth's climate system. Human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are major contributors to this change.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Earth's average temperature has risen by 1.1°C since the 19th century.</li>
        <li>Sea levels are rising due to melting glaciers and expanding seawater.</li>
        <li>Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Climate Change Myths</h2>
      <p>Let’s bust some common myths:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Climate change is a natural cycle.<br><strong>Truth:</strong> While the climate does change naturally, current changes are happening much faster and are linked to human activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> It’s too late to do anything.<br><strong>Truth:</strong> Every action helps. Reducing emissions now can limit future damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Ghana doesn't contribute to climate change.<br><strong>Truth:</strong> Every country plays a role, and every country can be part of the solution.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
      <p>Even small actions add up. Here's how you can help:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plant trees and support green spaces.</li>
        <li>Use public transport, bike, or walk when possible.</li>
        <li>Reduce, reuse, and recycle to cut down waste.</li>
        <li>Spread awareness about climate change in your community.</li>

      <h2>Climate Change in Ghana</h2>
      <p>Ghana is experiencing the effects of climate change through irregular rainfall patterns, droughts, and rising temperatures. These changes affect agriculture, water resources, and health.</p>
      <p>But Ghana is also taking action through education, renewable energy projects, and climate-smart farming. Young people like you are leading the charge for a sustainable future.</p>
